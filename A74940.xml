            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have in my Legacy of Huſbandry bequeathed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto thee concerning Silk-worms, which hath wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many to ſearch after the means to advance that part of Husbandry. But becauſe the Letter of King <hi>Iames</hi> to the Lords Lievtenants of the ſeverall Shires of <hi>England,</hi> for the increaſing of Mulberry Trees, and the breeding of Silk-worms, for the making of Silk in this Nation, had not annexed unto them in that Treatiſe the Inſtructions ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that purpoſe, and being but few, wholly out of print, and very much deſired: I thought good upon the occaſion of the printing of this Letter to thoſe of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to publiſh it alſo for the benefit of thoſe who ſhall be willing to employ themſelves in this way of induſtry, which ſeemeth to be brought unto a more perfect and ſpeedy accompliſhment than heretofore hath been known either here or in <hi>France,</hi> as by the contentes of this adjoyned Letter (wherein the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a vertuous Lady of this Nation for the breeding of Silk-worms, is addreſſed unto the Planters of <hi>Virginia</hi>) is ſet forth to encourage both them and others to ſet upon this work, to benefit themſelves and the Nation thereby. And truly the Gentleman who doth addreſſe this Letter to the Planters of the Virginian Colonie is much to be commended for his affection to the publick, becauſe he doth not conceal (as ſome Muck-worms do for private ends) the Advantages
<pb facs="tcp:168169:3"/> which may be reaped by ſingular induſtrious Attempts or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of profit; but deſires the benefit of others, even of all, to be encreaſed. And it were to be wiſhed, that every one to whom God (from whom comes every good &amp; perfect gift) doth impart any rare and profitable Secret of Induſtry, would open himſelfe towards his Brethren, as this publick-hearted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman doth; then would all hands be ſet a work, and every one would become inſtrumentall to ſerve himſelf and his Neighbours in Love, and overcome the burthen of povertie, which for want of employment and decay of Trade, doth lie ſo heavie upon very many, whoſe burthens might be either born, or made eaſie, if all the gifts of God were made uſe of, for the end for which he doth beſtow them, namely, to profit withall towards others, as it becommeth the Members of the ſame Chriſtian, and Human, and Nationall Society; for the ſame rule holds in all theſe reſpects among ſuch as underſtand what it is to be a good Commonwealths-man in the State, as well as in the Communion of Saints: And to this good and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inclination, which I wiſh may more and more abound in them with the grace of God, I ſhall leave thee and reſt,</p>

               <head>What ground is fit for the <hi>Mulberry-ſeeds,</hi> how the ſame is to be ordered, and in what ſort the ſeeds are to be ſowed therein.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ground which ought to be apointed for this purpoſe, beſides the natural goodneſs of it, muſt be reaſonably well dunged, and withall ſo ſituated, as that the heat of the Sun may cheriſh it, and the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping blaſts of either the North wind or the Eaſt, may not annoy it: The choice thereof thus made; that the ſeeds may the better proſper, and come up after they be ſown, you ſhall dig it two foot deep, breaking the clods as ſmall as may be, and afterwards you ſhall divide the ſame into ſeverall Beds of not above five foot in breadth, ſo that you ſhall not need to indanger the Plants by treading upon them, when either you water or weed them.</p>
               <p>The Mulberry ſeeds you ſhall lay in water for the ſpace of 22 hours, and after that you ſhall dry them again half dry, or ſome what more, that when you ſow them they may not cleave together: Thus done, you muſt caſt them upon the foreſaid Beds, not altogether ſo thick as you uſe to do other garden Seed, and then cover them with ſome fine earth (paſt through a Sive) about half an inch thick. In dry weather you ſhall water them every two dayes at the fartheſt, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the plants that ſhall come of them; and keep them as clean from weeds as poſſibly you can.</p>
               <p>The time in which you ought to ſow them for your beſt advantage, is either in <hi>March, April,</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> when froſts are either altogether paſt, or at the leaſt not ſo ſharp, or of ſo long continuance, as to indanger their upſpring.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:168169:4"/>
               <p>There is yet another way to ſow them, and that is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: you ſhall (being directed by a ſtrait line) make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain furrows in the Beds above mentioned, of ſome four fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers deep, &amp; about a foot in diſtance the one from the other: After this, you ſhall open the earth with your hands, on either ſide of the aforeſaid furrows, ſome two fingers from the bottom, and where you have ſo opened it, ſhall you ſow your ſeeds; and then cover them half a finger thick with the earth which before you opened.</p>

               <head>When the Plants that are ſprung up of the Seeds, are to be removed, and how they are to be planted the firſt time.</head>
               <p>IN the moneths of <hi>September, October, November, December, March,</hi> or <hi>April</hi> the next yeer after the Seeds are ſown, you may remove their plants, (or in the moneth of <hi>January,</hi> if it be not in froſty weather) and ſet them in the like Beds as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and about one foot the one from the other, but firſt you muſt cut off their roots about eight inches in length, and their tops about half a foot above their roots, more or leſſe, according to the ſtrength of the ſaid plaints, for the weaker they be the leſſe tops you ſhall leave them. In this ſort you may ſuffer them to remain weeding and watering them (as need ſhall require) till they be grown ſix foot in length above their roots, whereunto when once they have attained, you may cut their tops, and ſuffer them to ſpread, alwayes having a care to take away the many branches or ſuccours, that may any way hinder their growth untill they be come to their full length of ſix foot, as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>IN the moneths aforeſaid, (according as your plants are waxen ſtrong) you may remove them either into the hedges of your fields, or into any other grounds. If in hedges, you muſt ſet them 16 foot the one from the other: if in other ground, intending to make a Wood of them 18 foot at the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168169:4"/> leaſt. But a moneth before you do remove them, you muſt make the holes (wherein you purpoſe to ſet them) about four foot in breadth, and ſo deep as that their roots may be well covered, and ſome half a foot of looſe earth left under them, having alwayes a ſpecial care ſo to place them, that they may receive the benefit of the Sun, and not to be ſhadowed or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſpread by any neighbouring trees.</p>

               <head>When and how the Eggs of the Silk-wormes are to be hatched, and how to order the Wormes that ſhall come of them.</head>
               <p>VVHen the leaves of Mulberry-trees begin a little to bud forth, take the eggs of your Silk-worms, and lay them in a piece of Say, or ſuch like ſtuff, and in the day time carry them in ſome warm place about you, in a little ſafe box, but in the night either lay them in your bed or between two warm pillows, untill ſuch time as the Wormes begin to come forth: then take a piece of paper of the wideneſs of the ſaid box, and having cut it full of ſmall holes, lay it within the ſame upon the eggs, and upon that again ſome few Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery-leaves, to which the Wormes as they are hatched, will continually come. Theſe leaves with the Wormes upon them, you muſt ſtill remove into other boxes, laying freſh leaves as well on thoſe that are removed as on the paper where the eggs are; and this is the courſe which muſt be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept and obſerved, untill ſuch times as all the Wormes be come forth of their ſhels, ſtill keeping their boxes warm, as aforeſaid; but no longer about you, but untill the Wormes begin to come forth, out of which boxes you may ſafely take them, when once they have paſt their ſecond ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and feed them upon ſhelves of two foot in breadth, and 18 inches one above the other.</p>
               <p>The ſaid ſhelves are not to be placed in any ground-room, nor yet next unto the tiles, but in ſome middle room of your houſe which openeth upon the North and South, that you may the more conveniently give them either heat or aire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the time and ſeaſon ſhall require. Beſides you muſt not make them cloſe unto the Wals, but ſo as you may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168169:5"/> paſſe about them the better to look unto the Wormes, and keep them from Rats and Mice, which otherwiſe might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure them. You muſt obſerve the times of their comming forth, and keep every one, one or two dayes hatching by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that you may the better underſtand their ſeverall ſickneſſes or ſleepings, which are foure in the time of their feeding. The firſt commonly ſome twelve dayes after they are hatched, and from that time at the end of every eight dayes, according to the weather, and their good or ill uſage, during which time of every ſickneſſe, which laſteth two or three dayes, you muſt feed them but very little, as onely to relieve ſuch of them, as ſhall have paſt their ſickneſſe before the reſt, and thoſe that ſhall not fall into their ſickneſſe ſo ſoon.</p>
               <p>The whole time that the Worms do feed, is about nine Weeks, whereof untill they come unto their firſt ſickneſſe, give them young Mulbery-leaves twice every day, but few at a time; from thence untill their ſecond ſickneſs, twice every day in greater quantity; and ſo from their ſecond to their third ſickneſſe, increaſing the quantity of the leaves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you perceive the Wormes to grow in ſtrength, and clear of ſickneſſe: from the third untill their fourth ſickneſſe, you may give them leaves thrice every day, and the fourth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt, you may let them have ſo many as they will eat, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes having a care that you give them none, but ſuch as are dry, and well aired upon a Table or cloth, before they be laid upon them, and withall gathered ſo neer as may be; at ſuch times as either the Sun or Winde hath cleared them of the dew that falleth upon them.</p>
               <p>For the feeding of Worms you need obſerve no other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then this, lay the Mulberry-leaves upon them, and every two or three dayes remove them, and make clean their boxes, or ſhelves, unleſſe in times of their ſickneſſe, for then they are not to be touched; the leaves which you take from them when you give them freſh to feed upon, you muſt lay in ſome convenient place, and upon them a few new leaves, to which the Worms that lay hidden in the old, will come, and then you may paſſe them with the ſaid new leaves
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168169:5"/> to the reſt of the worms: And now leſt any thing ſhould be omitted, which ſerves to perfect the diſcovery of ſo excellent a benefit, I will adviſe you to be very diligent in keeping clean their Boxes, or ſhelves, as being a ſpeciall means whereby to preſerve them; wherefore when you intend to do it, you ſhall remove them together with the uppermoſt leaves where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they lie, unto other boxes or ſhelves, for with your hands you may not touch them, till they have throughly undergone their third ſickneſſe, and then may you paſſe them gently with clean hands, without doing them any harm: provided that the party that commeth neer them ſmell not of Garlick, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the like. The firſt five weeks of their age you muſt be very carefull to keep them warm, and in time of rain or cold weather, to ſet in the room where they remain, a pan with coals, burning in it now and then ſome Juniper, Benjamin, and ſuch like, that yieldeth ſweet ſmels. But afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in time of extraordinary cold, give them aire, and take heed of keeping them too hot, being alwayes mindfull to ſtore the room with herbs and flowers which are delightfull and pleaſing to the ſmell. As the wormes increaſe in bigneſs, you ſhall diſperſe them abroad upon more boards, or ſhelvs, and not ſuffer them to lie too thick together: and if you finde any of them broken, or of a yellow gliſtering colour inclining to ſickneſs, caſt them away, leſt they infect the reſt, and ſort ſuch as are not ſick, the greateſt and ſtrongeſt by themſelves, for ſo the leſſer will proſper the better.</p>

               <head>When and how to make fit rooms for the worms to work their bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of ſilk in, and in what ſort the ſaid bottoms are to be uſed.</head>
               <p>AS ſoon as by the clear amber-coloured bodies of your worms, you ſhall perceive them ready to give their ſilk, you muſt (with heath made very clean, or with the branches of Roſmary, the ſtalkes of Lavender, or ſuch lik) make Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es between the foreſaid ſhelves.</p>
               <p>Vpon the branches and ſprigs whereof, the wormes will faſten themſelves, and make their bottoms, which in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes after the worm beginneth to work them, you may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168169:6"/> take away; and thoſe which you are minded to uſe, for the beſt ſilk, you muſt either preſently winde, or kill the worms which are within them, by laying the ſaid bottoms two or three dayes in the Sun or in ſome Oven after the bread baked therein is taken out, and the fierceneſs of the heat is alaid. The other bottomes which you intend to keep for ſeed, you muſt lay in ſome convenient warme place, untill the worms come forth, which is commonly ſome ſixteene or twenty dayes from the beginning of their work: and as they do come forth you muſt put them together upon ſome piece of old Say, Grogeran, the backſide of old Velvet, or the like, made faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome Wall, or Hangings in your houſe.</p>
               <p>There they will ingender, and the Male having ſpent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, falleth down, and in ſhort time after dieth, as alſo doth the Female when ſhe hath laid her egges, which egges, when you perceive them upon the Say or Grogran, &amp;c. to be of a grayiſh colour, you may take them off gently with a knife, and having put them into a piece of Say or ſuch like, keep them in a covered box amongſt your woollen cloaths, or the like till the year following: But not in any moiſt room, for it is hurtfull for them, neither where there is too much heat, leaſt the wormes ſhould be hatched before you can have any food for them.</p>

            <head>An Extract of a Letter from <hi>Germany,</hi> concerning Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, written to <hi>S. H,</hi> Eſquire.</head>
            <p>AS for keeping of Silk-worms I muſt confeſs I have ſpent likewiſe ſome time in the ordering and obſerving of them in as much as this very yeare (1653) I have had from them ſo much good Silk (and equal to that which is brought either out of <hi>Perſia</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi>) as have made mee two paire of Stockings. And I have found by experience that they may be kept as well in <hi>Germany</hi> as in other Countries, and that Mulberry-trees will grow in abundance upon our Lands; wherefore I have often wiſhed that the Emperour (of <hi>Germany</hi>) would follow the moſt laudable example of the K. of <hi>France,</hi> who having forbidden the importation of foraigne Silk into his Kingdom hath thereby ſo much obliged the induſtry of the People of <hi>France,</hi> that they are come to a great perfection in this Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Manufacture. But concerning the Experiments of making Silk out of Nettles or out of Flax, I never have tried either of them. Only I remember that I have ſeene once a very fine and delicate yarne or thred, which was made purely out of Nettels. I do not believe, that thoſe Artiſt of <hi>Hamburg</hi> and <hi>Wolfenbuttel</hi> which you have named unto mee in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will communicat their Skil for a publique good, as long as they can get their own comfortable ſubſiſtance by it.</p>

            <head>A Letter written by Mr. Ra. <hi>Auſten,</hi> from <hi>Oxford,</hi> Febr. 18. 1654. Imparting his Experiments about Silk-worms and how to wind off the Silk from the Bottoms, when the Worms have done ſpinning?</head>
            <p>COncerning my experiences about Silk-worms, I only ſay thus much. That I am fully ſatisfied upon good and ſure grounds that the keeping of them (ſtore of them) in theſe parts would be of very great profit, could we but get Mulbery leaves ſufficient to feed them. For upon my own knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience (laſt yeare) upon ſome thouſands of them, I ſee what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168169:7"/> might be by more. For my great doubt and queſtion was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied about the winding of the Silke from the Bottoms, when the Worms have done ſpinning. I plainly ſee it is very eaſy, Children of 6. or 7. yeares old can apprehend it, and do it. For the Worms having done ſpinning, which is within 4. or 5. dayes of their beginning, through out-mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> ſilke is ravelled off, and the end is found immediately, which runnes on (5. or 10. or 16. or more bottoms together) in a baſon of water, a little gum drag mixed. Some Bottoms (if the Worms were ſtrong and well fed) run without breaking, ſcarce once or twice till all be off, and ſuch as break, are quickly found again. The truth is, if the Worms are ſcanted of leaves, their ſilk is ſo ſmall, that it holds not ſo well as that of luſty Worms. I ſaw many brave Skains of Silk wound off the laſt yeare, and help't to do part of it my ſelf. Now the great matter is, How to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Mulberry-trees enough. As for the ordinary way, by boughes, we can have but few that way. I am from time to time experimenting other wayes by Seed, Inoculating, Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c: what will be the reſult, as yet I know not: I doubt not, but God will in his good time bring to light and ſet on foot many good and worthy deſignes, more then are in theſe Nations. We had need to labour to be of the like Principles of that worthy perſon, whoſe Paper you encloſed, patiently and humbly to waite the Lords ſeaſon, and to deſigne for God in all we go about, which will crowne our endeavours with comfort and ſucceſs.</p>

            <p>'Tis not the hundreth part of your care, labour, or toyl you take about your Tobacco, and an hundred times (as I may ſay) all things put together more gain and profit to you then you make by Tobacco, which in truth is but ſmoak and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, but this a reall-royall-ſolid-rich-ſtaple Commodity.</p>
            <p>And yet if you will have ſtill ſmoak, ſo this neither will nor can hinder your labour in that, or take from you any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther employment you have a minde unto.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:168169:8"/>
            <p>Conſider, conſider I pray you (beloved friends) your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable happineſs in this thing, and bleſs God for it. Surely I ſhould much wrong your judgements and patience if I ſhould ſpend any more arguments to perſwade you to this ſo great benefit to you, and ſhould be like to him that to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the clear Sun-ſhine at noon-day, brought in a candle.</p>
            <p>In a word, there's nothing is or can be wanting but your true thankfulneſs to God for compleating this happy inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and your preſent ſpeedy putting it in practice.</p>
            <p>Yet give me leave, before I bid you adieu, to add the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable joy this Lady hath, who is confidently perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (her daily prayers are to God for it) that this new invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way of thus keeping Silkworms on the Trees; it requiring neither skill nor pains, (this laſt being the only <hi>Remora,</hi> in the Savages nature, which witholds them from attempting any thing of labour) that when the Indians ſhall behold and ſee you begin the buſineſs, they will with all alacrity ſet upon it likewiſe, and imitate you. And that you to incourage them (as well you may) do agree with them, that for every pound-weight of Silk-bottoms they bring unto you, you give them (as well it deſerves) 5 <hi>ſhil.</hi> worth in any Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities they deſire.</p>
            <p>And thus by the bleſſing of Almighty God, there may be good hope of their civilizing and converſion; ſo that they may be likewiſe great gainers both in body and ſoul by this thing. And if this prove ſo, (Gods mercies and workes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far beyond our capacities) how much then indeed will <hi>Virginia's</hi> happineſs be every way raiſed to the height of Bliſſe. The promiſe being made, <hi>That they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to righteouſneſſe, as the ſtars for ever and ever;</hi> which the God of wiſdome and power grant to you all in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and ſo, Lord, proſper this work in their hands, Lord, proſper their handy-work; good luck I wiſh you all in the name of the Lord, <hi>Amen, Amen, Amen.</hi>

            <p>Now the two Propoſitions that tend to infinite welfare, benefit, and wonderfull advantage both to <hi>England</hi> and the Colony joyntly, are thoſe that follow, they which upon no terms are to be omitted to be publiſhed and effected.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that with all ſpeed ſome kinde of Coyne be ſent to <hi>Virginia,</hi> that may be authorized to paſſe there for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and better trading. But whether all ſilver ſomewhat va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued above its worth, or part ſilver and part copper, is left to the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e judgments in that caſe. But of this confidently be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that without ſome kinde of coyn or other, that Colony can no way proſper or thrive, nor any ſtaple-commodities be ſet up, or Artificers in any kinde follow their profeſſions: for Tobacco being now their money, and that with which all Commerce is driven, and paiments made in, and paſſeth from man to man; all men are ſet upon that thing with the neglect of all other rich and ſolid innumerable Commodities that are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168169:9"/> in that land to be had: and till this remedy of Coyne be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, there can be no proſperity in that Colony. Were not the thing as apparent to all mens underſtandings as light is from darkneſſe; I ſhould alledge many reaſons for it, but it's ſo needleſſe to ſpend time about it, as it might well be thought a great abſurdity. What then remains? but that ſome publique ſpirited Patriot that would immortalize his name and honour in the procuring of this ſo neceſſary a thing to be ſpeedily effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, wherein alſo as the generall good he ſhall do, ſo the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit will be ever great to thoſe that ſhall undertake the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over this Coyne; be it what it will be, all men know it ſo well what the gain will be, as there's no need to name it in particular manner, they cannot wiſh for more profit then that will be to the undertakers, and the Colony will with all their hearts be content with it, and eſteeme them happy and thrice happy Benefactours.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, that a Publication be procured and ſent to the Colony in <hi>Virginia,</hi> declaring unto them, that there ſhall be liberty for all men to bring from thence for the ſpace of ten years to come, any commodity that they ſhall there raiſe, into <hi>England,</hi> Cuſtome and Excize free, (Tobacco onely excepted, which may pay double Cuſtome, if ſo thought fit:) and further that to what value of money ſuch commodities ſhall be ſold for here in <hi>England,</hi> (being rated at the Cuſtome-houſe at their entry;) it ſhall be lawfull to carry out to <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> any Commodities again to the ſame proportion &amp; worth, Cuſtome and Excize free.</p>
            <p>Theſe two reaſonable things granted; as they ſhall infinitily with all ſpeed advance the Plantation, ſo ſhall they (all things duly weighed in the ſcale of prudence) be no leſſe beneficiall to <hi>England,</hi> as all men that have their eyes in their heads, and Engliſh hearts in their bodies, ſee and apparantly know, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſure and certain; and all ſtable and needfull Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities brought out of all-liberall-<hi>Virginia</hi> into <hi>England</hi> at a very reaſonable rate and price, much cheaper then now we have them, and are fain to fetch them with great hazard from doubtfull friends, or Heathen Nations, to their great enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and our own impoveriſhing, as to all knowing men is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:168169:10"/> moſt apparent; we ſhall be free from the uſurpation of forreign Princes and States in our Eſtates, Lives, Liberties and ſhipping: and we may conclude boldly and rejoycingly, that Providence hath provided this all-ſufficient Countrey of <hi>Virginia</hi> againſt theſe times, and to theſe intents, that hence we may have all we want from our own brethren, our Navy there increaſed to what number we pleaſe; for this incomparable land affords na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally all whate're belongs to the building and rigging of a Navy in all compleat manner from top to toe, as may be ſaid; and by a ſafe, a ſure, certain, eaſie, near at hand weſterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And to this intent I now declare unto you, (that all excuſe may be taken from you) that the poor ſimple people in <hi>Italy, Spain, Languedock, Provence, &amp;c.</hi> do keep and feed their Silk-worms in the ſame low earthen-floored Rooms, wherein themſelves lodge and do all their houſhould-affairs, feeding them on ſhelves and on tables, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them leaves without any more curioſity, and they thrive and proſper with them as well as in the greateſt Cities and ſtately chambers of the greateſt rich mens Palates.</p>

            <p>The Silke Bottome of the naturall Worm in <hi>Virginia,</hi> found there in the Woods, is ten Inches about, and ſix Inches in length to admiration: &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ours in <hi>Europe</hi> have their Sleave and looſe Silke on the outſide; and then in a more cloſer covering they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombe themſelves. Theſe rare Worms, before they incloſe themſelves up, fill with Silke the great emptineſſe, and afterwards incloſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the middle of it, ſo they have a double Bottom.</p>
            <p>The looſe Sleave Silk is all on the outſide of this compaſs, for if that were reckoned in, the compaſſe of the Bottom would far exceed this proportion: But this is ſufficient to be the Wonder of the whole World: to the Glory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and Exaltation of <hi>VIRGINIA.</hi>

But not longer to detain from you this moſt precious eye-ſalve, for the ſpeedy curing of your infirmity, and making you all rich (which is your main aime in that new world).</p>
         </div>
         <div type="informations">
            <head>Hearken well to theſe Informations, which the Lady earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires may thus be with all ſpeed made known to you all.</head>
            <p>THe one Traveller declared, That he paſſed a Countrey where he ſaw thoſe people had their Silk-worms feeding on their Mulberry-trees in the fields &amp; there they live &amp; ſpun their Bottoms on the trees, And to protect this noble profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table creature &amp; to defend it from the birds, they uſed a moſt ſlight, ſimple, plain invention ſpeedily effected &amp; of no coſt or labour to them, which was certain great ſheets of Reeds or Canes, that they hung over and about their trees, tied to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poles that incompaſſed them. And in this eaſie manner they obtained great abundant quantities of ſilk, to their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful inriching. The ſheets of Reeds were joyned together by a need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and thred, running through each Reed at ſeveral equal diſtances, and ſo drew them cloſe and firm together. This for you to imitate, is in every reſpect to your wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full happineſs.</p>
            <p>Another of theſe Travellers ſaith, That he paſſed a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where the inhabitants did make large Tents or Boothes all of Reeds and Canes, and in them placed ſhelves and tables made likewiſe of Reeds, on which they fed their Worms, ſtrewing leaves on them. Theſe tents they ſet up round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Mulberry-Groves, and with much celerity, and no coſt.</p>
            <p>A third Gentleman and Merchant, that lived long in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168169:13"/> fartheſt parts of <hi>Turkey,</hi> affirmeth, That there the inhabitants begin every Spring, <hi>March,</hi> to feed their Worms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it till <hi>October,</hi> ſix moneths time: their Worms hatching &amp; re-hatching, one generation or brood ſucceeding the other: ſo that they have three harveſts of ſilk-bottoms, in that ſpace of time, every five or ſix weeks one: they feed their Worms in great long Barns made of Reeds or Canes, the walls and roofs of them, and ſhelves as aforeſaid, and the Wormes when they have done feeding, ſpin their bottoms upon the reedy walls and roofs; and that they have two crops of leaves from their trees: for thoſe trees that have their leaves pull'd off in <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> do re-leave again, and have new and freſh leaves in <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> wherewith they feed their latter generation or brood of Wormes very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.</p>
            <p>And in confirmation of this, you ſhall know, the ſame hath been found true in <hi>England,</hi> that the Mulberry-tree will leave twice in a Summer, the Lady had the experience of it, and therefore much more will it do with you, which will be a moſt ſingular advantage to you.</p>
            <p>I muſt not omit to add what theſe Gentlemen farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, that you can never ſufficiently augment the ſtore of food for this Noble Creature: for ſtore of food is the main foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, upon whoſe ſpeeding the Silk-trade is to be erected: for if that be not wanting, no obſtruction can be in it. For the glorious Worm is ſo infinite in multiplication, with that celerity as is incredible, ſo that ſhe will never be defective unto you: they therefore counſell, that you graft your Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries with all care and ſpeed upon theſe ſeverall trees, upon which they will exceedingly thrive, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Popler,</hi> the <hi>Elme,</hi> the <hi>Cheſnut, Beech, Quince, Medler, Fig, Peare, Apple,</hi> and <hi>Cornell</hi>-trees. And alſo upon any other trees, of which upon a trial you find the Worm will taſte or eat their leaves. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that you ſet of your Mulberry-ſlips as big as your thumb, about two foot long: and put them into good wel-digg'd ground in <hi>September,</hi> ſetting them a foot in the ground, brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ends of them, and watering them the next Summer well, if need be: in the ſame manner as in <hi>Kent,</hi> they ſet the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168169:14"/> Codling-ſlips. That you alſo cauſe the <hi>Indians</hi> to bring unto your habitations all the young Mulberry-trees that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an hundred miles of your Colony. But let me acquaint you that they admire what ſome Gentlemen Planters of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit tell them; that your brave Wormes do not onely live, feed, and ſpin upon the Mulberry-trees in the Woods, but do the ſame upon the <hi>Poplar</hi>-trees, <hi>Plum</hi>-trees, and <hi>Apple</hi>-trees:: ſuch an incouragement to the <hi>Silk-trade,</hi> the World (ſay they) never yet heard of before, which muſt needs lift you up to a moſt ſpeedy and incomparable height of wealth and riches, in a moment of time.</p>
            <p>And by your gentle patience and generoſity, give me leave to propound unto you, the earneſt requeſt the Lady hath to all of you; that you pleaſe to inform her (being alſo the deſire of many others) how it comes to paſs that your Wormes get to your ſeverall trees, not only to the <hi>Mulberry,</hi> but to others: For in no other Countreys the <hi>Silk-worme</hi>-flie doth uſe her wings to flie with: ſo that yours muſt either do it (and ſo at time of yeer couple and flie to ſundry trees; and there lay their eggs which remain till Spring again) or that your trees do naturally ingender and produce the Wormes (as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the original of them ſo hapned at firſt) but which way ſoever it be, it's rare and remarkable; and proves <hi>Virginia</hi> to be one of the moſt ſuperlative Countreys in all the Vniverſe for the <hi>Silk-trade;</hi> and none comparable unto the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of its naturall temper for <hi>Silk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then that you alſo inform her all you can of the nature, actions, qualities and diſpoſitions in all kindes of this moſt wonderfull Creature, every way ſo admirable, what by any <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Savage</hi> hath bin any way obſerved in her: when her eggs firſt hatch, then how long time ſhe is feeding before ſhe ſpins, upon what part of the trees ſhe faſtens her Bottom; How long ſhe continues in her Bottom before ſhe comes out a Fly, then when they couple, where they lay their eggs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what part of the trees? How long they live after that time? For theſe in the old World never eat after they once begin to ſpin: how large in bigneſs and compaſs are commonly their bottoms? if all of one colour, or divers? In what part
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168169:14"/> of the Countrey are moſt of them ſeen and found? what do the <hi>Savages</hi> call them, or know any uſe of them; what birds are they that moſt devoure them? (for did they not, they would ſwarm all the Land over in a very few yeers); if any thing beſides birds be hurtfull to them? Their greatneſs and doubleneſs of their Bottoms are wonderful, none ever known to be ſo, which argues the ſtrength and richneſs of this noble Worm, her vigour and hardnes exceeds, that can endure all wethers and ſeaſons both alive and in her eggs. A great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to you all that ſhe is not a nice curious kinde of <hi>Silkworme;</hi> but ſtout and robuſtous, that will require little care or attendance, of ſmall coſt unto you. But her food and protection is all ſhe requires, and pays you ten thouſand-fold for what you beſtow on her. That you pleaſe to ſend of her Bottoms to ſatisfie all men, who are like the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> much better truſt their eyes than eares; ſome of their eggs likewiſe upon that which they lay them, and the Fly (though dead) which will many a yeer retain her perfect form in a box: do not the wormes hatch and ſpin twice or thrice in a Summer?</p>
            <p>Let me add one Petition more, and I have done. <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome of your precious Silk-graſs may be ſent the Lady, who is confident upon the triall ſhe will make of it, ſhe will give you ſo pleaſing an account and ſo profitable unto you, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known unto you what an unknown wealth you have: ſhe prays you (and all is for your own gain) to bore and cut all your trees (a moſt eaſie thing) and thereby you ſhall diſcover preſently, what rich Gums, what Balſoms, what Oils, and precious healthful Liquours they will yield you for profit &amp; neceſſity: For all men know that many kindes of trees do yield moſt pleaſant and healthſome Wines (as I may call them) for man to drink; ſo alſo you will finde out all ſorts of Dies and Colours (inſtantly done): cut and bruiſe all kindes of your Woods, Barks, and Leaves of Trees, Roots, Berries, Nuts, Fruits, Plants, Weeds; and but boil them in a Skillet, and then put in a little piece of white Woollen or Linnen cloth with ſome Allom, and you ſhall inſtantly finde and ſee what rich Colours they will make. What is <hi>Indico</hi> but a Weed, ſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168169:15"/> 
               <hi>Woad</hi> and <hi>Madder?</hi> What is <hi>Braſil, Fuſtick, Logwood,</hi> and many more kinde of Dies, but Woods? what Coucheneal the rich Scarlet die, but a Fly, or the excrements of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fig-tree? what is the new-found rich dying ſtuff of 25. <hi>l.</hi> a Tun, but of a tree that is brought from the Iſland of <hi>Liberty,</hi> neer Cape <hi>Florida</hi> where Captain <hi>Sailes</hi> plants? And ſhall <hi>Virginia</hi> not yield a drop of good Liquour or Colour? It cannot be; if but a triall thus eaſie were made.</p>
            <p>By burning of all kinde of Woods and Gums, you'le ſoon finde by your noſe what ſweet Perfumes they yield. And by the ponderouſneſs or weight of earths, you may know if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals or not? Let it be known alſo, if you have not Waters of more than ordinary qualities; for taſte, colours, ſmell, weight, hotneſs, or coldneſs? there is much depends upon them. And you ſhall know if they proceed out of any Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, by taking a glaſs full, and putting into it a Gall beaten to powder, which will turn the water into a reddiſh colour: and ſend ſamples of all kinde of ſtrange earths, and of all other kinde of things without fail. And laſtly, (if it be not too much preſumption to beg the favour to receive that honour from you) which ſhe no wayes deſerves nor can hope to requite: To inform her what be the things, the wayes, the means to advance <hi>Virginia's Proſperity,</hi> if they may be procured and effected. If any errour be committed in telling you all this: there is hope your pardon may be obtained, ſeeing your onely good and benefit hath cauſed all this that hath been ſaid: and the zeal of your wealth and happineſs hath drawn all to this length:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs,</hi> you have the faithful teſtimonies of thoſe aforeſaid worthy Gentlemen, and nothing can be now wanting unto you but putting all in practice, what they have declared; and for your good are ſuch invitations and incouragements unto you, that more cannot be wiſhed for. There remains nothing but humble thanks to God, and to theſe Gentlemen your due reſpects, whom God hath made ſuch Inſtruments for your happineſs, hoping their noble courteous examples will allure all other Gentlemen Travellers to caſt into this good work ſome mites of their further knowledges, and every man
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168169:15"/> to contribute his prayers and help to this or any other hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deſigne: ſeeing the conſequence of them may be ſo good and great, not only to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation at home and abroad; but to the poor <hi>Savages</hi> their welfare of ſouls and bodies, which God grant.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168169:16"/> produced by heat and moyſture as our Caterpillars and other Inſects each Spring, partly by Eggs which have eſcaped the Birds who are the greateſt cauſe of their ſcarſity (which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would ſwarm over all the Land) devouring them when they are Worms, Eggs and Bottoms) exceed ours not only in ſtrength, hardineſſe and greatneſſe, (being when Flyes as big as mens Thumbs) but alſo in the largeneſſe of their Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which are as big as Limons; (for Mr. <hi>William Wright</hi> of <hi>Nanſamond</hi> found of them above ſeven inches round) and one of them weighs more then a ſcore of ours; inſomuch that whereas a Thouſand of our Worms made but one pound of Silk, worth at moſt here 30s. a pound, a thouſand of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Worms will make ten pounds of Silk, worth here twenty ſhillings the pound. And certainly they need not object or be troubled at the ſomewhat more courſneſſe of their Silk, ſince they from the ſame number of Worms receive ten pounds in mony for our thirty ſhillings.</p>
            <p>As for their Food, the <hi>Virginia</hi> Worms feed not only on the Mulberry (their ſole food in all other parts of the World) but alſo on the Crab, Plum, Poplar; Oake, Apple, Cherry and Pohickerry-tree leaves, with ſundry other ſhrubs and buſhes. For proof whereof, Miſtreſſe <hi>Mary Ward</hi> ſent over to her Couzen ten bottoms taken from Apple trees. Eſquire <hi>Ferrar</hi> her Kinſman likewiſe ſent her ten more, pulled off from Oaks and divers ſhrubs. Mr <hi>Laurence Ward</hi> ſome taken from the Pohickerry tree, Mr <hi>Wright</hi> from the Cherry tree. So Dr <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The Objection, or rather groundleſſe ſurmiſe of the Worms being hurt by Thunder in <hi>Virginia,</hi> is ſufficiently cleared, not only by the Natural Worms living ſo well, and thriving there ſo admirably on the trees; but alſo by trial made there this Spring of our Worms. That ever to be honoured Noble Squire <hi>Diggs</hi> having (at his very great charge) ſent for two <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> out of <hi>Turky</hi> skilful men, and made ten pound of Silk, which had not want of Eggs hindred him, would have been ſo many Thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>Nothing then wants to make <hi>Virginia</hi> rival <hi>Peru</hi> for wealth, more then to perſwade the Planters to provide themſelves this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168169:16"/> Winter (to loſe no more time) of as many of the Natural Worms bottoms as poſſibly they can. They will now be found in the Woods on the diſ-leaved trees, though moſt of them are ſpun by the Worms on the tree leaves, which falling to the ground, they periſh with them; and this is another great cauſe that ſo few bottoms are to be found. The Bottoms thus gotten muſt be carefully kept in ſome long boxes till the Flyes come forth, happily in February or March. For they remain in their bottoms 300. dayes, ours but 20. ſo that their Eggs (whereof one female will lay a ſpoonfull, ſuppoſe 500.) lye unhatched but about nine dayes, ours nine moneths.</p>
            <p>When your Worms are hatched, you may keep them either on the trees (being aſſured that they will live on that kind of Tree whatſoever it be from whence you took your Bottoms) and then you ſhall need onely to protect them from the Birds; or elſe in ſome ſlight kind of houſing, Reedy arbors, Indian manſions, or what elſe you can deviſe there cheapeſt and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt, and then your onely labour and care is to give them leaves, which you may either ſtrip off, or clip from off your Trees, or if you will, lop off little branches (which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps prove a good way for you: for thereby the leaves will remain the longer freſh) and give them to your Worms, who for the labour of every Man and Boy thus inployed only in two moneths time, will repay you with threeſcore pounds worth of Silk.</p>
            <p>Your own Experience (Gentlemen) will I hope ere this time twelv-moneth certifie you of the truth that is here ſet down, unleſſe you ſhall rather chuſe to hugg your own poverty, and make much of that ſlavery and drudgery you wear out your ſelves with, in toyling about that contemptible, beggarly <hi>Indian</hi> Weed, <hi>TOBACCO.</hi>

            <p>I Have received your many and ſeverall Letters, printed papers, and Quaeries; and, would my occaſions have permitted, I ſhould ere this, have given you that due thanks you deſerve, and punctually have anſwered all your judicious and pleaſing Quaeries: But I was ſo taken up in ſending dayly for Mulberry-leaves, as they are now ſo far ſcattered from my preſent Plantation, that I could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly anſwer your expectations; That onely difficulty made me to make but 400. pound weight of Silk-bottomes, which I cauſed to be wound of 7. or 8. l. of Silke in a day: Sir, I doe very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of your laſt well printed Paper, ſent the Colony for making triall of the Naturall Silk-worme, but ſuch was my ill happe, that I could not this ſpring meet with any of thoſe Bottoms, but ſhall this next Winter procure of them, all I can; Sir, I am now confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I have conquered all the great feared difficulty of this rich commodity, and made its ſweet eaſy and ſpeedy Profitt ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all the Virginians (and that it doth not at all hinder their too much beloved <hi>Tobacco,</hi> but that they may proceed with both together) that now I doubt not (nor they) but that in a ſhort time here will be great quantities made of Silke; you in <hi>England</hi> will reape much advantage, and gaine many waies by it, (more then moſt men can pet ſee) and I by Gods bleſſing the comfort and joy, in ſetting up ſo noble, ſo beneficiall, a ſtaple vendible commodity. My people differ very little from the rules ſet down in your, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his Booke, and as Eſquire <hi>Samuell Hartlib</hi> hath alſo directed in his advertizement of Silk-worms unto us; only in the hatching of the Worms-Eggs, they are more curious, of which I ſhall, when I have more time, give you a more particular accompt: I made 10. l. of ſeed or Eggs this ſpring to give away to diverſe Planters, that are very earneſt (ſeeing ſo great a benefit before their eyes) to become alſo Silk-maſters, you need not feare it but that this next ſpring there will be divers tryalls made of the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Naturall Worms, that you ſo highly prize (and not without good cauſe) and which is more, perhaps they may fall one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:168169:17"/> and be re-hatched that we may have a double Silk harveſt in one ſummer (as you have formerly hinted to us).

Sir, this your favour is both by my-ſelf and Daughter ſo much reſented as it requires from us, very hearty and particular thanks to be tendered to your worth. She is a lover of Rarities in theſe kinds, and to try concluſions upon her Silk-worms, and no way envious, but much rejoyces to heare that any have had that good ſucceſs with Lettis as you write of, and ſhall her-ſelf againe make a third triall in that kind, for ſhe hath 2. yeares laſt paſt tryed her-ſelf to have kept ſome with Lettice leavs &amp; ſo did &amp; they thrivd as well as they kept with Mulberrys, but ſtil when the time of ſpinning came they would not ſpin, but then dyed and this put her out of heart to try further, yet I may tell you, ſhe perſwaded a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman near her to keep ſome with Lettice 25. daies and then fed them with Mulberrys at laſt, and theſe did very well and ſpun as good Bottoms as thoſe wholly kept with Mulberry
